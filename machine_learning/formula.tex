The softmax function is defined as follows:

\[
\text{softmax}(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{x_j}}
\]

This equation represents the softmax function applied to the element $x_i$ of a vector $x$ of length $n$. The numerator exponentiates $x_i$, while the denominator sums the exponential values of all elements in the vector. The result is the probability distribution over the elements, with each element being between 0 and 1, and the sum of all elements equal to 1.
